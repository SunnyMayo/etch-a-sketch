Simple etch-a-sketch project as part of The Odin Project

Page initialises with a 16x16 pixel grid that responds to mouseover by darkening the square.

Users can reset the grid to 16x16 at any time, or enter their own number between 1-100 to set the grid to that length and width.

Each square increases in opacity every time the mouse hovers over, up to ten interactions before being fully opaque.
